                        The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a 
                        computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for 
                        everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own 
                        but still want a high quality education.

                        The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, 
                        it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming 
                        to work on their own personal projects.

                        The Odin Project curriculum is full of projects that will help you build a strong portfolio of work on GitHub to fill out your resume...

                The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a 
                computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for 
                everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own 
                but still want a high quality education.                       
                The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, 
                it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming 
                to work on their own personal projects.
