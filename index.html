                    Hello! I'm Dikson Manganye, and I am a front-end developer 
                    at Unemployed working extensively on website development. After learning Java,Python and C#, I stated studying for 
                    web development with Meta and soon found myself specializing in front-end development. I am 
                    willing to expand my horizons to projects looking for software support and consultancy.
                    I've done a some work with HTML, CSS, Node , Boostrap and JavaScript, and I have experience building web apps that handle 
                    large amounts of data. I can help you with your next project if you're looking for someone who knows how to 
                    work with large-scale projects while still being able to focus on small details like user experience design 
                    and implementation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I created this webside to Serve as a guide 
                    for people who want to learn front-end development, I hope that is helps and 
                    that you are happy the content and its presentation. All the best in your learning 
                    journey and remember to take things one step at a time, <strong> giving up is not an option!! </strong>
                </p>
                <h1>If you dont yet have a good idea of what Frontend development is and what it is about, don't worry, that is what this platform is for.</h1>
                <p class="home-site-paragraph">
                    Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website 
                    that users interact with directly. It's a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where 
                    HTML provides the structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic behaviour 
                    and interactivity. As a front-end developer, you'll be responsible for creating the user 
                    interface of a website, to ensure it looks good and is easy to use, with great focus on design 
                    principles and user experience. You'll be working closely with designers, back-end developers, 
                    and project managers to make sure the final product meets the client's needs and provides the 
                    best possible experience for the end-users. Front-end developers are also known as front-end engineers, front-end 
                    
                    web developers, JavaScript Developers, HTML/CSS Developer, front-end web designers, and front-end web architects.
                    Each of these roles mostly encompass the same front-end development skills but require different levels of 
                    expertise in different front-end development skills. It's better to look at the job description to get an idea about the job requirements.
