                    Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website 
                    that users interact with directly. It's a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where 
                    HTML provides the structure, <br> CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic behaviour 
                    and interactivity. As a front-end developer, you'll be responsible for creating the user 
                    interface of a website, to ensure it looks good and is easy <br> to use, with great focus on design 
                    principles and user experience. You'll be working closely with designers, back-end developers, 
                    and project managers to make sure the final product meets the client's needs <br> and provides the 
                    best possible experience for the end-users. Front-end developers are also known as front-end engineers, front-end 
                    
                    web developers, JavaScript Developers, HTML/CSS Developer, front-end <br> web designers, and front-end web architects.
                    Each of these roles mostly encompass the same front-end development skills but require different levels of 
                    expertise in different front-end development skills. <br> It's better to look at the job description to get an idea about the job requirements.
